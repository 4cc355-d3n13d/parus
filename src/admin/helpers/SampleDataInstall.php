               a 35 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR).<br /></p><p>The total revenue is small potatoes compared to Amazon Web Services (AWS), but the growth rate is great. </p><p>451
               observed that so far OpenStack-based revenue has been overwhelmingly 
              from service providers offering multi-tenant Infrastructure-as-a-Service
               (IaaS). Looking ahead, though, 451 believes OpenStack\'s future success 
              will come from the private cloud space and in providing hybrid-cloud 
              orchestration for public cloud integration.  Better still, for OpenStack
               companies, 451 sees private cloud revenue exceeding public cloud by 
              2019. </p><p>This focus on the private cloud was clearly visible in the OpenStack Summit keynote speeches. Tech leaders from Banco Santander, a Spain-based international bank, and Sky,
               one of Europe\'s leading television and internet companies, both sang 
              the praises of OpenStack on the private cloud. Both companies are also 
              using a distribution-based OpenStack approach: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for Santander and Ubuntu for Sky. </p><p>451
               Research also predicted that OpenStack will grow across 
              software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization 
              (NFV), mobile, and Internet of Things (IoT) for both service providers 
              and enterprises. This is in addition to its existing use cases in big 
              data and lines of business. The keynotes, again, supported this 
              conclusion. Representatives from Huawei, NEC, and Nokia all sang 
              OpenStack\'s praises in business and telecom.         </p><p>That\'s not to say that everyone thinks OpenStack will do best in private or hybrid cloud environments. Germany telecom giant Deutsche Telekom is using OpenStack as the foundation for its public cloud. </p><p>But it\'s not all wine and roses for OpenStack looking ahead. </p><p>"This
               year OpenStack has become a top priority and credible cloud option, but
               it still has its shortcomings," said Al Sadowski, 451 Research\'s 
              research VP.  For example, while OpenStack is still growing in

              time in the education space. The cloud-based file sharing company is 
              partnering with Blackboard, the provider of the leading learning 
              management system (LMS) for both K-12 schools and universities, to 
              natively integrate Dropbox into the LMS product Blackboard Learn.</p><p>Dropbox is focused on providing a content collaboration platform
               that can work on any number of applications. As part of that effort, 
              the company is heavily invested in building key partnerships. </p><p>"We\'re
               making some very big bets on which one of those applications are 
              important, and Blackboard is a key one for us in the education space," 
              Billy Blau, Dropbox\'s head of technology partnerships, told ZDNet. </p><p>When Dropbox launched Dropbox Education
               earlier in May -- its file sharing service designed specifically for 
              colleges and universities -- it offered a lightweight integration with 
              Blackboard\'s mobile app. </p><p>Now, Dropbox will be embedded directly 
              into Blackboard Learn, enabling students to collaborate on projects 
              together and submit them to Blackboard through Dropbox, and allowing 
              professors to communicate with students. While many Dropbox users are 
              already collaborating with Blackboard, Dropbox is confident that the LMS
               provider -- with 100 million users -- will advance Dropbox\'s push into 
              the education sector. When Dropbox Education launched, it had more than 
              4,000 univerities on board, and it now has about 6,000 universities and 
              institutions using it globally.  </p><p>The new integration, however, is
               available for all Dropbox products, not just Dropbox Education. Dropbox
               is the only enterprise file-syncing and sharing company with this 
              relationship with Blackboard.         </p><p>Blau said Dropbox will continue to build these kinds of partnerships. "You\'ve seen it with Office 365 and Adobe
               -- deep product integrations are helping drive significant business for
               us," he said. "Users don\'t want to toggle back and forth between

               is the king of the online mapping industry, but that doesn\'t mean that 
              the Google Maps app is the best navigation app for your Android phone. 
              There are plenty of other navigation apps on the market, and most of 
              them are just as speedy and accurate as Google Maps (some are more so). 
              Google Maps is a good 
                      <em>general </em>maps app, but if you commute all day long or you primarily use public transit, it may not be the best app for you.
              </p><p> 	  Here are five other Android navigation apps you might want to check out:
              </p><h3><strong>Waze</strong></h3><p> 	  Waze is technically owned by Google, but this "social" navigation app is completely separate from Google Maps. While Google Maps is a general navigation app, Waze
               is driving-focused, which means it offers some cool features like 
              user-reported gas prices and turn-by-turn directions to parking lots 
              near your destination. The app also has a robust community of users, and
               it uses this community to gather real-time traffic data and 
              user-reported incidents, such as accidents, road closures, speed cameras
               and police traps.
              </p><p> 	  If you\'re looking for a friendly driving 
              community that\'s committed to keeping the public informed about upcoming
               speed traps, Waze is the app for you. This app is all about social 
              networking, so you can also plan trips with friends, sync events from 
              your phone\'s calendar as well as your Facebook account and see the ETAs 
              of friends who are traveling to the same place as you are.

               (which was originally developed for the Windows Phone platform by 
              Nokia) is a free app that offers turn-by-turn directions for drivers, 
              pedestrians, cyclists and public transit riders. The app also features 
              real-time traffic information, nearby points of interest, the ability to
               share your location (or the location of a point of interest) with 
              friends and family members and offline map downloads for when you don\'t 
              have a data connection.
              </p><p> 	  Here WeGo offers just about everything
               Google Maps does, and a little more. The cycling directions and the 
              public transportation overlays are useful, and the app\'s points of 
              interest system is also pretty strong (the app pulls info from places 
              like Wikipedia, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Expedia, Car2go and 
              GetYourGuide).
              </p><h3><strong>Moovit</strong></h3><p> 	  If you take public transportation frequently, you\'ve probably noticed that Google Maps\' directions are very basic. Moovit
               is a free, dedicated transit app that offers several features you won\'t
               find in Google Maps, such as step-by-step directions that will tell you
               how many stops you have left and alert you when it\'s time to get off 
              the bus, train or ferry you\'re riding. Moovit also features an entire 
              section dedicated to information about delays, maintenance and service 
              interruptions. It also links you to the local transit agencies\' Twitter 
              accounts, so you can 
                      <em>really </em>feel like a local.

According to the report, Park Won-sang, an engineer for Samsung\'s
               display manufacturing unit, said that the front of next year\'s phone 
              will be over 90 percent screen space. The average display area ratio 
              (which is the percentage of the front of the phone taken up by the 
              screen) of current smartphones
               is around 80 percent, according to The Investor report. If this rumor 
              is true, this would mean that the S8 could feature at least 10 percent 
              more screen than earlier devices. It is unknown how Samsung\'s famous curved displays would count for this percentage.</p><p>But
               Samsung isn\'t planning on stopping at 90 percent. According to the same
               engineer, Samsung could aim for a device that is up to 99 percent 
              screen. This reflects an ongoing trend to make smartphones mostly 
              screen. Recently we got to see the Xiaomi Mi Mix,
               a phone that is almost entirely screen. Regardless of whether this 
              Galaxy S8 rumor is true, it wouldn\'t be surprising to see more phones 
              come out next year with higher display area ratios.</p><p>The Investor 
              report also adds a few other speculations about what to expect from the 
              upcoming Galaxy S phone. This includes an OLED display, and a bezelless 
              body.  Although the Galaxy S8 has not yet been officially announced, these new rumors fall in line with previous rumors
               that suggest a full-screen display. Additionally, the existence of a 
              full-screen display on the S8 corresponds with the idea that it would 
              get rid of the home button and feature a fingerprint sensor under the display.</p><p>However,
               until Samsung unveils its next Galaxy S phone, these rumors should be 
              regarded as only speculation. Samsung did not immediately respond to 
              CNET\'s request for comment.</p>','hits' => '8','image' => 'the-samsung-galaxy-s8-could-be-mostly-screen','post_type' => 'post','published_at' => '2016-11-07 09:53:34','publish_up' => NULL,'publish_down' => NULL,'language' => 'en','view' => '','version' => '2','reference' => '','created_by' => $userId,'created_at' => '2016-11-07 09:53:34','modified_by' => $userId,'modified_at' => '2016-11-07 11:36:38','meta_title' => '','meta_keywords' => '','meta_description' => '','deleted_at' => NULL),

               global technology conference in Laguna Beach, California, that the 
              instant messaging app\'s plans to help its one billion users better 
              communicate with businesses is much about necessity and demand.</p><p>"I
               haven\'t met anybody who is on hold [while on the phone] and gets 
              excited about it," said Koum, attracting laughs from the crowd. "If we

               transaction or receiving a notification a flight delay. To make this 
              happen, however, WhatsApp is sharing users\' phone numbers with its 
              parent Facebook, which drew some criticism over privacy. </p><p>The significant change comes more than two years since being acquired by social media behemoth Facebook.
               While the change makes it easier for businesses to contact users, Koum 
              and Acton both promised users\' privacy won\'t be compromised and there 
              will be "no spam."</p><p>Despite users\' phone numbers being linked to 
              Facebook, Koum reiterated they will be secure thanks to the introduction
               two years ago of end-to-end encryption two. </p><p>"We never really had
               a lot of information about our users to begin with," he said. "We never
               asked our users for their names, for their gender, for their ages or 
              where they live, so it\'s not like we\'re sitting on this wealth of 
              information.</p><p>"We always built our system in a way [so we] know as little information about our users as possible," Koum concluded. </p><p>Regarding
               Facebook\'s role in the company, Koum and Acton said the social media 
              giant has been very supportive and somewhat hands-off. </p>','hits' => '11','image' => 'whatsapps-creators-say-theyre-committed-to-users-privacy','post_type' => 'post','published_at' => '2016-11-07 10:12:58','publish_up' => NULL,'publish_down' => NULL,'language' => 'en','view' => '','version' => '5','reference' => '','created_by' => $userId,'created_at' => '2016-11-07 10:12:58','modified_by' => $userId,'modified_at' => '2016-11-07 15:54:19','meta_title' => '','meta_keywords' => '','meta_description' => '','deleted_at' => NULL),
